#### Project Description:

A research paper exploring the relationship between managed public greenspaces and mental and physical self-reported health in Baltimore City. This was analyzed using spatial regression at the census tract level with GeoDa software. Results did not indicate a significant relationship, rather that socioeconomic indicators (i.e. Area Deprivation Index) were most influential on health outcomes. The full paper can be downloaded below.
